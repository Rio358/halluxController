# halluxController-
Emergency vehicle light controller made specifically for the FiveM framework.


The halluxController is a very basic, easy to use. This resource simply turns on & turns off "extras" 7 - 12 in which are setup on vehicles as lights to control the light patterns. This allows the user to control which lights they would like active at any particular time. 

This was created roughly 3 years ago, the coding is awful, it can be refactored. If you chose to do so, please feel free to PR so the main repo can be updated accordingly.
